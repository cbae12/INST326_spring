Please upload a Jupyter notebook in which you briefly explain the following concepts in your own words and provide clear, working, original examples of each:

	- assert statements
	- testing floating-point values with math.isclose() (or, if you are feeling adventurous, pytest.approx() (Links to an external site.), which wasn't in the lecture but which I like better)
	- import statements (choose either flavor #1 or flavor #3 from the videos; demonstrate the import statement and how to use an imported function given the flavor of import you chose)

You are expected to use Markdown cells for explanations and code cells for code.
