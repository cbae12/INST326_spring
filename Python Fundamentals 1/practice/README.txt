- Please upload a Jupyter notebook in which you explain the following concepts in your own words and provide clear, working, original examples of each:

	- conditional expressions
	- passing keyword arguments to functions
	- defining functions with optional parameters

- Your notebook should include brief but clear explanations for each of your examples. You are expected to use Markdown cells for explanations and code cells for code. I encourage you to look at the example submission for reference.
