To complete this practice, you will need a CSV with multiple columns of numeric data. If you don't have one in your back pocket, here are a few you could use:

	- World Happiness Report 2021: https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021 (Links to an external site.)
	- Student Performance in Exams: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams (Links to an external site.)
	- Fortune 1000: https://www.kaggle.com/winston56/fortune-500-data-2021 (Links to an external site.)

Upload a Jupyter Notebook (not a Python script!) in which you read your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and demonstrate how to create

	- one of the following: a bar chart OR a histogram
	  AND
	- one of the following: a Seaborn lmplot OR a Seaborn joint plot

Explain the contents of each of your plots and what conclusion we can draw from the plot.

Please run all code cells in your notebook before submitting. Jupyter Notebooks include powerful integration with Pandas. If the last statement in a Jupyter Notebook code block is an expression that evaluates to a DataFrame, Jupyter will render the DataFrame as an HTML table.
