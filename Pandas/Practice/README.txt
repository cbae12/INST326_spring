- To complete this practice, you will need a CSV file with a header row. If you don't have one in your back pocket, here are some you could use:

	- Stroke prediction dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset (Links to an external site.)
	- Country, regional, and world GDP: https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/country-regional-and-world-gdp (Links to an external site.)
	- Disneyland reviews: https://www.kaggle.com/arushchillar/disneyland-reviews (Links to an external site.) (please note: this dataset uses iso-8859-1 encoding, not utf-8)

- Upload a Jupyter Notebook (not a Python script!) in which you do the following:

	- Explain what a DataFrame is
	- Create a DataFrame of the data in your CSV file using the Pandas read_csv() function
	- Use a boolean Series (or a boolean expression that would evaluate to a boolean Series) to filter your data. (This operation is called "boolean indexing (Links to an external site.)".) Explain what you did and why it works
	- Explain how to select a column from a DataFrame using the column label; provide code that demonstrates how to do this

- Please run all code cells in your notebook before submitting. Jupyter Notebooks include powerful integration with Pandas. If the last statement in a Jupyter Notebook code block is an expression that evaluates to a DataFrame, Jupyter will render the DataFrame as an HTML table.
