- Please upload a Jupyter notebook in which you explain the following concepts in your own words and provide clear, working, original examples of each:

	- f-strings
	- Lists
		- Choose at least two things about lists from the lecture videos that are new to you or that you need practice with. Explain them briefly but clearly; summarize the syntax for them; provide illustrative examples.
	- Reading the contents of a file with a with statement, using the file object as an iterator in a for loop
		- You may need to create a small text file for your code to read.

- You are expected to use Markdown cells for explanations and code cells for code. I encourage you to look at the example submission for reference.
