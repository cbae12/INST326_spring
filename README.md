Extended Course Description
</summary>
This course introduces object-oriented design and programming (OOP) concepts and methods using the Python programming language. Object-oriented programs are built as collections of “objects”, which are software representations of real-world entities and concepts. Objects combine data (attributes) with functionality (methods), and work through communicating with each other as the code is executed. By encapsulating code complexity within objects, OOP allows use and reuse of existing code in a relatively simple and easy manner. Advanced OOP concepts such as inheritance and composition facilitate development of complex code without sacrificing robustness and possibility of code reuse. We apply computational thinking approaches such as abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic design, generalization, evaluation, and debugging.

This course also provides opportunities to develop an understanding of how programming is situated in and reflects broader social structures, constructs and issues, e.g. race, class or gender. Programming is often viewed as a value-neutral technical skill. However, the social and cultural impacts of information and technology are central concepts in our field, and the growing awareness of issues like algorithmic bias, ethical/unethical uses of algorithms and disparities in opportunties in tech jobs require that any informed professional needs to understand the larger context of programming. This is important to be ethical professionals and to be successful in the workplace. Through readings, discussion and writing, we will critically examine issues of racism, sexism and other forms of power and oppression that are pervasive in programming and related technical activities, and discuss what companies and individuals are doing to improve programming practices and professional work environments.

## Student Learning Outcomes

After finishing this course, students will be able to:

1. Use object-oriented programming principles, concepts, and 
   methods.

2. Design and program object-oriented applications to solve 
   non-trival problems.

3. Write accurate and useful in-code comments and other code 
   documentation.

4. Test and assess the quality of object-oriented code.

5. Use the concept of object-oriented design patterns, and apply 
   basic design pattern solutions to relevant programming problems.

6. Explain how programming is situated in and reflects social 
   issues and concerns around diversity, inclusion, equality and justice, and describe actions that individuals or organizations are taking to counteract disparities and inequalities.
